kraken is a turn-key OCR system optimized for historical and non-Latin script
material.

Features
========

kraken's main features are:

  - Fully trainable layout analysis and character recognition
  - `Right-to-Left <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-to-left>`_, `BiDi
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bi-directional_text>`_, and Top-to-Bottom
    script support
  - `ALTO <https://www.loc.gov/standards/alto/>`_, PageXML, abbyXML, and hOCR
    output
  - Word bounding boxes and character cuts
  - Multi-script recognition support
  - `Public repository <https://zenodo.org/communities/ocr_models>`_ of model files
  - :ref:`Lightweight model files <models>`
  - :ref:`Variable recognition network architectures <vgsl>`

Pull requests and code contributions are always welcome. 

Installation
============

Kraken can be run on Linux or Mac OS X (both x64 and ARM). Installation through
the on-board *pip* utility and the `anaconda <https://anaconda.org>`_
scientific computing python are supported.

Installation using Pip
----------------------

.. code-block:: console

  $ pip install kraken

or by running pip in the git repository:

.. code-block:: console

  $ pip install .

If you want direct PDF and multi-image TIFF/JPEG2000 support it is necessary to
install the `pdf` extras package for PyPi:

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip install kraken[pdf]

or

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip install .[pdf]

respectively.

Installation using Conda
------------------------

To install the stable version through `conda <https://anaconda.org>`_:

.. code-block:: console

   $ conda install -c conda-forge -c mittagessen kraken

Again PDF/multi-page TIFF/JPEG2000 support requires some additional dependencies:

.. code-block:: console

   $ conda install -c conda-forge pyvips

The git repository contains some environment files that aid in setting up the latest development version:

.. code-block:: console

  $ git clone git://github.com/mittagessen/kraken.git 
  $ cd kraken
  $ conda env create -f environment.yml

or:

.. code-block:: console

  $ git clone git://github.com/mittagessen/kraken.git 
  $ cd kraken
  $ conda env create -f environment_cuda.yml

for CUDA acceleration with the appropriate hardware.

Finding Recognition Models
--------------------------

Finally you'll have to scrounge up a recognition model to do the actual
recognition of characters. To download the default English text recognition
model and place it in the user's kraken directory:

.. code-block:: console

  $ kraken get 10.5281/zenodo.2577813

A list of libre models available in the central repository can be retrieved by
running:

.. code-block:: console

  $ kraken list

Model metadata can be extracted using:

.. code-block:: console

  $ kraken show 10.5281/zenodo.2577813
  name: 10.5281/zenodo.2577813

Quickstart
==========

The structure of an OCR software consists of multiple steps, primarily
preprocessing, segmentation, and recognition, each of which takes the output of
the previous step and sometimes additional files such as models and templates
that define how a particular transformation is to be performed.

In kraken these are separated into different subcommands that can be chained or
ran separately:

.. raw:: html
    :file: _static/kraken_workflow.svg

Recognizing text on an image using the default parameters including the
prerequisite step of page segmentation:

.. code-block:: console

  $ kraken -i image.tif image.txt segment -bl ocr
  Loading RNN     ✓
  Processing      ⣻

To segment an image into reading-order sorted baselines and regions:

.. code-block:: console

  $ kraken -i bw.tif lines.json segment -bl

To OCR an image using the default model:

.. code-block:: console

  $ kraken -i bw.tif image.txt segment -bl ocr

To OCR an image using the default model and serialize the output using the ALTO
template:

.. code-block:: console

  $ kraken -a -i bw.tif image.txt segment -bl ocr

All commands and their parameters are documented, just add the standard
``--help`` flag for further information.

Training Tutorial
=================

There is a training tutorial at :doc:`training`.

Related Software
================

These days kraken is quite closely linked to the `escriptorium
<https://escriptorium.fr>`_ project developed in the same eScripta research
group. eScriptorium provides a user-friendly interface for annotating data,
training models, and inference (but also much more). There is a `gitter channel
<https://gitter.im/escripta/escriptorium>`_ that is mostly intended for
coordinating technical development but is also a spot to find people with
experience on applying kraken on a wide variety of material.

<p>kraken is an optical character recognition package that can be trained fairly
easily for a large number of scripts. In contrast to other system requiring
segmentation down to glyph level before classification, it is uniquely suited
for the recognition of connected scripts, because the neural network is trained
to assign correct character to unsegmented training data.</p>
<p>Both segmentation, the process finding lines and regions on a page image, and
recognition, the conversion of line images into text, can be trained in kraken.
To train models for either we require training data, i.e. examples of page
segmentations and transcriptions that are similar to what we want to be able to
recognize. For segmentation the examples are  the location of baselines, i.e.
the imaginary lines the text is written on, and polygons of regions. For
recognition these are the text contained in a line. There are multiple ways to
supply training data but the easiest is through PageXML or ALTO files.</p>
<section id="installing-kraken">
<h2>Installing kraken<a class="headerlink" href="#installing-kraken" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The easiest way to install and use kraken is through <a class="reference external" href="https://www.anaconda.com/download/">conda</a>. kraken works both on Linux and Mac OS
X. After installing conda, download the environment file and create the
environment for kraken:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$ </span>wget<span class="w"> </span>https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mittagessen/kraken/master/environment.yml
<span class="gp">$ </span>conda<span class="w"> </span>env<span class="w"> </span>create<span class="w"> </span>-f<span class="w"> </span>environment.yml
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Each time you want to use the kraken environment in a shell is has to be
activated first:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$ </span>conda<span class="w"> </span>activate<span class="w"> </span>kraken
</pre></div>

<section id="image-acquisition-and-preprocessing">
<h2>Image acquisition and preprocessing<a class="headerlink" href="#image-acquisition-and-preprocessing" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>First a number of high quality scans, preferably color or grayscale and at
least 300dpi are required. Scans should be in a lossless image format such as
TIFF or PNG, images in PDF files have to be extracted beforehand using a tool
such as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pdftocairo</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pdfimages</span></code>. While each of these requirements can
be relaxed to a degree, the final accuracy will suffer to some extent. For
example, only slightly compressed JPEG scans are generally suitable for
training and recognition.</p>
<p>Depending on the source of the scans some preprocessing such as splitting scans
into pages, correcting skew and warp, and removing speckles can be advisable
although it isn’t strictly necessary as the segmenter can be trained to treat
noisy material with a high accuracy. A fairly user-friendly software for
semi-automatic batch processing of image scans is <a class="reference external" href="http://scantailor.org">Scantailor</a> albeit most work can be done using a standard image
editor.</p>
<p>The total number of scans required depends on the kind of model to train
(segmentation or recognition), the complexity of the layout or the nature of
the script to recognize. Only features that are found in the training data can
later be recognized, so it is important that the coverage of typographic
features is exhaustive. Training a small segmentation model for a particular
kind of material might require less than a few hundred samples while a general
model can well go into the thousands of pages. Likewise a specific recognition
model for printed script with a small grapheme inventory such as Arabic or
Hebrew requires around 800 lines, with manuscripts, complex scripts (such as
polytonic Greek), and general models for multiple typefaces and hands needing
more training data for the same accuracy.</p>
<p>There is no hard rule for the amount of training data and it may be required to
retrain a model after the initial training data proves insufficient. Most
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">western</span></code> texts contain between 25 and 40 lines per page, therefore upward of
30 pages have to be preprocessed and later transcribed.</p>
</section>
<section id="annotation-and-transcription">
<h2>Annotation and transcription<a class="headerlink" href="#annotation-and-transcription" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>kraken does not provide internal tools for the annotation and transcription of
baselines, regions, and text. There are a number of tools available that can
create ALTO and PageXML files containing the requisite information for either
segmentation or recognition training: <a class="reference external" href="https://escripta.hypotheses.org">escriptorium</a> integrates kraken tightly including
training and inference, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.primaresearch.org/tools/Aletheia">Aletheia</a> is a powerful desktop
application that can create fine grained annotations.</p>
</section>
<section id="id1">
<h2>Training<a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The training data, e.g. a collection of PAGE XML documents, obtained through
annotation and transcription may now be used to train segmentation and/or
transcription models.</p>
<p>The training data in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">output_dir</span></code> may now be used to train a new model by
invoking the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ketos</span> <span class="pre">train</span></code> command. Just hand a list of images to the command
such as:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$ </span>ketos<span class="w"> </span>train<span class="w"> </span>output_dir/*.png
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>to start training.</p>
<p>A number of lines will be split off into a separate held-out set that is used
to estimate the actual recognition accuracy achieved in the real world. These
are never shown to the network during training but will be recognized
periodically to evaluate the accuracy of the model. Per default the validation
set will comprise of 10% of the training data.</p>
<p>Basic model training is mostly automatic albeit there are multiple parameters
that can be adjusted:</p>
<dl class="option-list">
<dt><kbd><span class="option">--output</span></kbd></dt>
<dd><p>Sets the prefix for models generated during training. They will best as
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">prefix_epochs.mlmodel</span></code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><kbd><span class="option">--report</span></kbd></dt>
<dd><p>How often evaluation passes are run on the validation set. It is an
integer equal or larger than 1 with 1 meaning a report is created each
time the complete training set has been seen by the network.</p>
</dd>
<dt><kbd><span class="option">--savefreq</span></kbd></dt>
<dd><p>How often intermediate models are saved to disk. It is an integer with
the same semantics as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--report</span></code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><kbd><span class="option">--load</span></kbd></dt>
<dd><p>Continuing training is possible by loading an existing model file with
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--load</span></code>. To continue training from a base model with another
training set refer to the full <a class="reference internal" href="ketos.html#ketos"><span class="std std-ref">ketos</span></a> documentation.</p>
</dd>
<dt><kbd><span class="option">--preload</span></kbd></dt>
<dd><p>Enables/disables preloading of the training set into memory for
accelerated training. The default setting preloads data sets with less
than 2500 lines, explicitly adding <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--preload</span></code> will preload arbitrary
sized sets. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--no-preload</span></code> disables preloading in all circumstances.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Training a network will take some time on a modern computer, even with the
default parameters. While the exact time required is unpredictable as training
is a somewhat random process a rough guide is that accuracy seldomly improves
after 50 epochs reached between 8 and 24 hours of training.</p>
<p>When to stop training is a matter of experience; the default setting employs a
fairly reliable approach known as <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_stopping">early stopping</a> that stops training as soon as
the error rate on the validation set doesn’t improve anymore.  This will
prevent <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting">overfitting</a>, i.e.
fitting the model to recognize only the training data properly instead of the
general patterns contained therein.</p>

epochs is 545 incorrect characters out of 3504 characters in the validation set

<p>indicates that the training is running on 788 transcribed lines and a
validation set of 88 lines. 49 different classes, i.e. Unicode code points,
where found in these 788 lines. These affect the output size of the network;
obviously only these 49 different classes/code points can later be output by
the network.  Importantly, we can see that certain characters occur markedly
less often than others. Characters like the Syriac feminine dot and numerals
that occur less than 10 times will most likely not be recognized well by the
trained net.</p>

<p>While output during training is detailed enough to know when to stop training
one usually wants to know the specific kinds of errors to expect. Doing more
in-depth error analysis also allows to pinpoint weaknesses in the training

<p>The next table lists the number of insertions (characters occuring in the
ground truth but not in the recognition output), substitutions (misrecognized
characters), and deletions (superfluous characters recognized by the model).</p>
<p>Next is a grouping of errors (insertions and substitutions) by Unicode script.</p>
<p>The final part of the report are errors sorted by frequency and a per
character accuracy report. Importantly most errors are incorrect recognition of
combining marks such as dots and diaereses. These may have several sources:
different dot placement in training and validation set, incorrect transcription
such as non-systematic transcription, or unclean speckled scans. Depending on
the error source, correction most often involves adding more training data and
fixing transcriptions. Sometimes it may even be advisable to remove
unrepresentative data from the training set.</p>

<h2>Recognition<a class="headerlink" href="#recognition" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">kraken</span></code> utility is employed for all non-training related tasks. Optical
character recognition is a multi-step process consisting of binarization
(conversion of input images to black and white), page segmentation (extracting
lines from the image), and recognition (converting line image to character
sequences). All of these may be run in a single call like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$ </span>kraken<span class="w"> </span>-i<span class="w"> </span>INPUT_IMAGE<span class="w"> </span>OUTPUT_FILE<span class="w"> </span>binarize<span class="w"> </span>segment<span class="w"> </span>ocr<span class="w"> </span>-m<span class="w"> </span>MODEL_FILE
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>producing a text file from the input image. There are also <a class="reference external" href="http://hocr.info">hocr</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.loc.gov/standards/alto/">ALTO</a> output
formats available through the appropriate switches:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$ </span>kraken<span class="w"> </span>-i<span class="w"> </span>...<span class="w"> </span>ocr<span class="w"> </span>-h
<span class="gp">$ </span>kraken<span class="w"> </span>-i<span class="w"> </span>...<span class="w"> </span>ocr<span class="w"> </span>-a
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>For debugging purposes it is sometimes helpful to run each step manually and
inspect intermediate results:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$ </span>kraken<span class="w"> </span>-i<span class="w"> </span>INPUT_IMAGE<span class="w"> </span>BW_IMAGE<span class="w"> </span>binarize
<span class="gp">$ </span>kraken<span class="w"> </span>-i<span class="w"> </span>BW_IMAGE<span class="w"> </span>LINES<span class="w"> </span>segment
<span class="gp">$ </span>kraken<span class="w"> </span>-i<span class="w"> </span>BW_IMAGE<span class="w"> </span>OUTPUT_FILE<span class="w"> </span>ocr<span class="w"> </span>-l<span class="w"> </span>LINES<span class="w"> </span>...
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>It is also possible to recognize more than one file at a time by just chaining
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-i</span> <span class="pre">...</span> <span class="pre">...</span></code> clauses like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$ </span>kraken<span class="w"> </span>-i<span class="w"> </span>input_1<span class="w"> </span>output_1<span class="w"> </span>-i<span class="w"> </span>input_2<span class="w"> </span>output_2<span class="w"> </span>...
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Finally, there is an central repository containing freely available models.
Getting a list of all available models:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$ </span>kraken<span class="w"> </span>list
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Retrieving model metadata for a particular model:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$ </span>kraken<span class="w"> </span>show<span class="w"> </span>arabic-alam-al-kutub
<span class="go">name: arabic-alam-al-kutub.mlmodel</span>

<span class="go">An experimental model for Classical Arabic texts.</span>

<span class="go">Network trained on 889 lines of [0] as a test case for a general Classical</span>
<span class="go">Arabic model. Ground truth was prepared by Sarah Savant</span>

</div>
<p>and actually fetching the model:</p>

</div>
<p>The downloaded model can then be used for recognition by the name shown in its metadata, e.g.:</p>

<p>kraken is an optical character recognition package that can be trained fairly
easily for a large number of scripts. In contrast to other system requiring
segmentation down to glyph level before classification, it is uniquely suited
for the recognition of connected scripts, because the neural network is trained
to assign correct character to unsegmented training data.</p>
<p>Training a new model for kraken requires a variable amount of training data
manually generated from page images which have to be typographically similar to
the target prints that are to be recognized. As the system works on unsegmented
inputs for both training and recognition and its base unit is a text line,
training data are just transcriptions aligned to line images.</p>
<section id="installing-kraken">
<h2>Installing kraken<a class="headerlink" href="#installing-kraken" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The easiest way to install and use kraken is through <a class="reference external" href="https://www.anaconda.com/download/">conda</a>. kraken works both on Linux and Mac OS
X. After installing conda, download the environment file and create the
environment for kraken:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$ </span>wget<span class="w"> </span>https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mittagessen/kraken/master/environment.yml
<span class="gp">$ </span>conda<span class="w"> </span>env<span class="w"> </span>create<span class="w"> </span>-f<span class="w"> </span>environment.yml
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Each time you want to use the kraken environment in a shell is has to be
activated first:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$ </span>conda<span class="w"> </span>activate<span class="w"> </span>kraken
</pre></div>

</section>
<section id="image-acquisition-and-preprocessing">
<h2>Image acquisition and preprocessing<a class="headerlink" href="#image-acquisition-and-preprocessing" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>First a number of high quality scans, preferably color or grayscale and at
least 300dpi are required. Scans should be in a lossless image format such as
TIFF or PNG, images in PDF files have to be extracted beforehand using a tool
such as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pdftocairo</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pdfimages</span></code>. While each of these requirements can
be relaxed to a degree, the final accuracy will suffer to some extent. For
example, only slightly compressed JPEG scans are generally suitable for
training and recognition.</p>
<p>Depending on the source of the scans some preprocessing such as splitting scans
into pages, correcting skew and warp, and removing speckles is usually
required. For complex layouts such as newspapers it is advisable to split the
page manually into columns as the line extraction algorithm run to create
transcription environments does not deal well with non-codex page layouts. A
fairly user-friendly software for semi-automatic batch processing of image
scans is <a class="reference external" href="http://scantailor.org">Scantailor</a> albeit most work can be done
using a standard image editor.</p>
<p>The total number of scans required depends on the nature of the script to be
recognized. Only features that are found on the page images and training data
derived from it can later be recognized, so it is important that the coverage
of typographic features is exhaustive. Training a single script model for a
fairly small script such as Arabic or Hebrew requires at least 800 lines, while
multi-script models, e.g. combined polytonic Greek and Latin, will require
significantly more transcriptions.</p>
<p>There is no hard rule for the amount of training data and it may be required to
retrain a model after the initial training data proves insufficient. Most
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">western</span></code> texts contain between 25 and 40 lines per page, therefore upward of
30 pages have to be preprocessed and later transcribed.</p>
</section>
<section id="transcription">
<h2>Transcription<a class="headerlink" href="#transcription" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Transcription is done through local browser based HTML transcription
environments. These are created by the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ketos</span> <span class="pre">transcribe</span></code> command line util
that is part of kraken. Its basic input is just a number of image files and an
output path to write the HTML file to:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$ </span>ketos<span class="w"> </span>transcribe<span class="w"> </span>-o<span class="w"> </span>output.html<span class="w"> </span>image_1.png<span class="w"> </span>image_2.png<span class="w"> </span>...
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>While it is possible to put multiple images into a single transcription
environment splitting into one-image-per-HTML will ease parallel transcription
by multiple people.</p>
<p>The above command reads in the image files, converts them to black and white if
necessary, tries to split them into line images, and puts an editable text
field next to the image in the HTML.</p>
<p>Transcription has to be diplomatic, i.e. contain the exact character sequence
in the line image, including original orthography. Some deviations, such as
consistently omitting vocalization in Arabic texts, is possible as long as they
are systematic and relatively minor.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>The page segmentation algorithm extracting lines from images is
optimized for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">western</span></code> page layouts and may recognize lines
erroneously, lumping multiple lines together or cutting them in half.
The most efficient way to deal with these errors is just skipping the
affected lines by leaving the text box empty.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="admonition-title">Tip</p>
<p>Copy-paste transcription can significantly speed up the whole process.
Either transcribe scans of a work where a digital edition already
exists (but does not for typographically similar prints) or find a
sufficiently similar edition as a base.</p>
</div>
<p>After transcribing a number of lines the results have to be saved, either using
the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Download</span></code> button on the lower left or through the regular <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Save</span> <span class="pre">Page</span>
<span class="pre">As</span></code> (CTRL+S) function of the browser. All the work done is contained directly
in the saved files and it is possible to save partially transcribed files and
continue work later.</p>
<p>Next the contents of the filled transcription environments have to be
extracted through the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ketos</span> <span class="pre">extract</span></code> command:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$ </span>ketos<span class="w"> </span>extract<span class="w"> </span>--output<span class="w"> </span>output_directory<span class="w"> </span>--normalization<span class="w"> </span>NFD<span class="w"> </span>*.html

</dd>
<dt><kbd><span class="option">--normalization</span></kbd></dt>
<dd><p>Unicode has code points to encode most glyphs encountered in the wild.
A lesser known feature is that there usually are multiple ways to
encode a glyph.  <a class="reference external" href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr15/">Unicode normalization</a> ensures that equal glyphs are
encoded in the same way, i.e. that the encoded representation across
the training data set is consistent and there is only one way the
network can recognize a particular feature on the page. Usually it is
sufficient to set the normalization to Normalization Form
Decomposed (NFD), as it reduces the the size of the overall script to
be recognized slightly.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The result will be a directory filled with line image text pairs <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">NNNNNN.png</span></code>
and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">NNNNNN.gt.txt</span></code> and a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">manifest.txt</span></code> containing a list of all extracted

<p>to start training.</p>
<p>A number of lines will be split off into a separate held-out set that is used
to estimate the actual recognition accuracy achieved in the real world. These
are never shown to the network during training but will be recognized
periodically to evaluate the accuracy of the model. Per default the validation
set will comprise of 10% of the training data.</p>
<p>Basic model training is mostly automatic albeit there are multiple parameters
that can be adjusted:</p>
<dl class="option-list">
<dt><kbd><span class="option">--output</span></kbd></dt>
<dd><p>Sets the prefix for models generated during training. They will best as

</dd>
<dt><kbd><span class="option">--savefreq</span></kbd></dt>
<dd><p>How often intermediate models are saved to disk. It is an integer with

<dd><p>Continuing training is possible by loading an existing model file with

sized sets. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--no-preload</span></code> disables preloading in all circumstances.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Training a network will take some time on a modern computer, even with the
default parameters. While the exact time required is unpredictable as training
is a somewhat random process a rough guide is that accuracy seldomly improves
after 50 epochs reached between 8 and 24 hours of training.</p>
<p>When to stop training is a matter of experience; the default setting employs a
fairly reliable approach known as <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_stopping">early stopping</a> that stops training as soon as
the error rate on the validation set doesn’t improve anymore.  This will
prevent <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting">overfitting</a>, i.e.
fitting the model to recognize only the training data properly instead of the
general patterns contained therein.</p>

<p>indicates that the training is running on 788 transcribed lines and a
validation set of 88 lines. 49 different classes, i.e. Unicode code points,
where found in these 788 lines. These affect the output size of the network;
obviously only these 49 different classes/code points can later be output by
the network.  Importantly, we can see that certain characters occur markedly
less often than others. Characters like the Syriac feminine dot and numerals
that occur less than 10 times will most likely not be recognized well by the
trained net.</p>

<p>While output during training is detailed enough to know when to stop training
one usually wants to know the specific kinds of errors to expect. Doing more
in-depth error analysis also allows to pinpoint weaknesses in the training
data, e.g. above average error rates for numerals indicate either a lack of
representation of numerals in the training data or erroneous transcription in
the first place.</p>

<p>The first section of the report consists of a simple accounting of the number
of characters in the ground truth, the errors in the recognition output and the
resulting accuracy in per cent.</p>
<p>The next table lists the number of insertions (characters occuring in the
ground truth but not in the recognition output), substitutions (misrecognized
characters), and deletions (superfluous characters recognized by the model).</p>
<p>Next is a grouping of errors (insertions and substitutions) by Unicode script.</p>
<p>The final part of the report are errors sorted by frequency and a per
character accuracy report. Importantly most errors are incorrect recognition of
combining marks such as dots and diaereses. These may have several sources:
different dot placement in training and validation set, incorrect transcription
such as non-systematic transcription, or unclean speckled scans. Depending on
the error source, correction most often involves adding more training data and
fixing transcriptions. Sometimes it may even be advisable to remove
unrepresentative data from the training set.</p>

<h2>Recognition<a class="headerlink" href="#recognition" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">kraken</span></code> utility is employed for all non-training related tasks. Optical
character recognition is a multi-step process consisting of binarization
(conversion of input images to black and white), page segmentation (extracting
lines from the image), and recognition (converting line image to character
sequences). All of these may be run in a single call like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$ </span>kraken<span class="w"> </span>-i<span class="w"> </span>INPUT_IMAGE<span class="w"> </span>OUTPUT_FILE<span class="w"> </span>binarize<span class="w"> </span>segment<span class="w"> </span>ocr<span class="w"> </span>-m<span class="w"> </span>MODEL_FILE
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>producing a text file from the input image. There are also <a class="reference external" href="http://hocr.info">hocr</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.loc.gov/standards/alto/">ALTO</a> output
formats available through the appropriate switches:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$ </span>kraken<span class="w"> </span>-i<span class="w"> </span>...<span class="w"> </span>ocr<span class="w"> </span>-h
<span class="gp">$ </span>kraken<span class="w"> </span>-i<span class="w"> </span>...<span class="w"> </span>ocr<span class="w"> </span>-a
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>For debugging purposes it is sometimes helpful to run each step manually and
inspect intermediate results:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$ </span>kraken<span class="w"> </span>-i<span class="w"> </span>INPUT_IMAGE<span class="w"> </span>BW_IMAGE<span class="w"> </span>binarize
<span class="gp">$ </span>kraken<span class="w"> </span>-i<span class="w"> </span>BW_IMAGE<span class="w"> </span>LINES<span class="w"> </span>segment
<span class="gp">$ </span>kraken<span class="w"> </span>-i<span class="w"> </span>BW_IMAGE<span class="w"> </span>OUTPUT_FILE<span class="w"> </span>ocr<span class="w"> </span>-l<span class="w"> </span>LINES<span class="w"> </span>...
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>It is also possible to recognize more than one file at a time by just chaining
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-i</span> <span class="pre">...</span> <span class="pre">...</span></code> clauses like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$ </span>kraken<span class="w"> </span>-i<span class="w"> </span>input_1<span class="w"> </span>output_1<span class="w"> </span>-i<span class="w"> </span>input_2<span class="w"> </span>output_2<span class="w"> </span>...
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Finally, there is an central repository containing freely available models.
Getting a list of all available models:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$ </span>kraken<span class="w"> </span>list

<p>Retrieving model metadata for a particular model:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$ </span>kraken<span class="w"> </span>show<span class="w"> </span>arabic-alam-al-kutub
<span class="go">name: arabic-alam-al-kutub.mlmodel</span>

<span class="go">An experimental model for Classical Arabic texts.</span>

<p>and actually fetching the model:</p>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The downloaded model can then be used for recognition by the name shown in its metadata, e.g.:</p>
